# Experimental 
Experimental fork of the Deforum A1111 extension with the intention of making "turbo-frames" controllable directly.
Will require an experimental version of Parseq to supply new "is-turbo-frame" values, fork here: https://github.com/Tok/sd-parseq

This is an experiment in progress and there's no good reason to install this as of now.
Check out the original project instead: https://github.com/deforum-art/sd-webui-deforum
